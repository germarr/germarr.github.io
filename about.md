I've spent the last 7 years working in digital strategy, business intelligence and marketing analytics.

From 2012 to 2019 I got the awesome opportunity to work for 2 of the most popular automotive brands in the world and on 2020, while finishing my master's degree, I changed gears and went on to do consulting work for Rappi (one of Latam's biggest startups) and Planet Fitness (one of the largest gym chains in the US)
